OCR(Optical Character Recognition) System - Part which Analyzing and Deleting Image

Created by Mehmet Zahid GENÃ‡ - 2022


^ Preliminary Information ^
___________________________

* An object of the Predictor class can be created by taking many parameters.
* After the object is created, a "self-method" is created by using the methods in it.
* This method consists of "analysis of images", "order of accuracy" and "deletion of unnecessary images".



^ Information of This Script's Method ^
_______________________________________

@Method: __init__                   : Introducing the necessary parameters. It has default values

@Method: get_model                  : Loading and returning the torch model using the parameters defined in the initializer method

@Method: get_info                   : It takes the image as input and the model which returned from the get_model method.
                                      In this method, the image is analyzed and then the average accuracy value and object rank are returned as output.

@Method: get_path                   : Returns a path that is updated every day using the actual_path retrieved
                                      by the __init__ method and using the day, month, year information

@Method: get_last_3_images_path     : Using the path returned from the get_path method,
                                      the paths of the last 3 images in the file are added to a list and the list is returned.

@Method: delete_unnecessary_images  : Using the get_info method, the images assigned to the list are analyzed and the necessary data is obtained.
                                      This data is stored in a list and it is arranged in a row to decide which images should be deleted,
                                      then the images that are not deemed necessary (2 images with the lowest accuracy value among the 3 images)

@Method: run_prediction_function    : It is a complex method. Although it is the method of the Predictor class,
                                      it is a combination of the other methods of this class.
